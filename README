COSC504 final program

Originally built on Ubuntu 19.10 using g++ 9.2 using C++11

Database can be built by selecting from the options menu or by
passing the name of the file into the program i.e. $ file <filename>

Directory structure:

- <base>:
	+ Makefile: the makefile. To build, run: "make" in this directory.
				It builds the program.
- <base>/src: contains the source files, these are compiled by the Makefile.
			  The files are
	+ main.cpp: contains main() and is the entry point into the program
	+ Student.cpp: contains the definition of the course and student classes
	+ Database.cpp: contains the definition of the database class
	+ Functions.cpp: contains the definition of the various helper functions
					 which handle the various aspects of the program
- <base>/include: contains the header files
	+ Student.h: contains the declaration for the course and student classes
	+ Database.h: contains the declaration for the database class
	+ Functions.h: contains the declaration for the helper functions
	+ LL.hpp: contains the declaration of definition of the linked list class.
			  since this class is templated, it abides by standard practice
			  of declaring and defining in the same file, as well as naming
			  it .hpp instead of .h/.cpp
- <base>/libs: contains the object files generating by intermediate compilation
			   of the various .cpp files. They are then used to link when
			   building the executable
- <base>/bin: contains the executable built by make
